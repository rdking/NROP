### NROP - the Node Remote Object Protocol
---
The NROP is a pair of libraries designed to implement a seamless remote procedure call (rpc) interface between the web client and its server. These libraries use AJAX methods to transmit requests and responses between the client and server, while appearing to be nothing more than an object method call.

While it is preferred that the library user make use of ES6 classes when using this library, it is not required. All library functionality will behave equally well should the developer desire to avoid the use of the `class` keyword.
